# Relational Operators
a=50

print("The value of a==b is",a==b) # equality operator ,'False' because 50 is not equal to 20

print("the value of a!=b is:",a!=b) # not equal to operator, 'True' because 50 is not equal to 20

print("the value of a>=b is:",a>=b) # greater than or equal to operator, 'True' because 50 is greater than 20

print("the value of a<=b is:",a<=b)  # less than or equal to operator, 'False' because 50 is not less than 20

print("the value of a>b is:",a>b) # greater than operator, 'True' because 50 is greater than 20

print("the value of a<b is:",a<b)   # less than operator, 'False' because 50 is not less than 20
